## What is this?

These are glasses that holographically project 'eyes' onto the user. I will insert my phone into the model, and then it will project a display onto a plastic sheet of paper. This goes over my eyes and makes me look like I have cool eyes.

## Why did I make this?

With my upcoming AMA with John Cohn, I thought it would be cool if I made something that is similar to the ones he wore during [Undercity](http://johncohn.org/base/2025/07/11/friday-night-undercity/)
